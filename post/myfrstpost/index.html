<p>Before coming to Amrita itself I had decided to try my level best to get into amFOSS. I am from a non-cse background. I studied Biology in 12th.But during my high school days I have tried a little bit of python. It seemed interesting to me. So after JEE and everything was over, I learned python. I tried to solve some Leetcode problems, but it seemed too difficult as I was a beginner. So I switched to Codechef and started doing problems of around 200 difficulty and then slowly leveling up. As I progressed, I was able to do problems of 1500 difficulty and I was also enjoying the process.</p>
<p>Then, the amFOSS Praveshan began. The initial tasks were easy. As I had been using Ubuntu for many years, I was comfortable with it and it helped me in task-01 as well. As I progressed through the tasks, it was getting difficult. Still, I tried my level best. Through this process, I was able to learn about different interesing fields.</p>
