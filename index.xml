      <description>amFOSS-Praveshan
Before coming to Amrita itself I had decided to try my level best to get into amFOSS. I am from a non-cse background. I studied Biology in 12th.But during my high school days I have tried a little bit of python. It seemed interesting to me. So after JEE and everything was over, I learned python. I tried to solve some Leetcode problems, but it seemed too difficult as I was a beginner.</description>
